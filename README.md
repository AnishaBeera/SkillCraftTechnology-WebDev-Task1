🌐 Excited to share my first task as a Web Development Intern at SkillCraft Technology!
🔹 Task 1: Responsive Landing Page
 In this task, I built a fully responsive landing page with:

 ✅ A fixed navigation bar that stays visible on scroll.

 ✅ Interactive menu styles on hover and scroll.

 ✅ Clean layout optimized for all screen sizes.

This experience helped me strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles. Looking forward to more learning and hands-on projects! 🙌
